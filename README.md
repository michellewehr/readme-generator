# README Generator

## Description

- Users are prompted with questions pertaining to sections of a readme, such as title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. When a user enters their input, their input is taken and used to create a readme file. In the table of contents on the created readme file, a user can click on the name and be directed to that section of the readme.
